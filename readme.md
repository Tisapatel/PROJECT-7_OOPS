# CrewCore: OOP-Based Employee & Company Management System

---

## 📌 About the Project

This project is built to **practice and apply JavaScript’s Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** through a real-world Employee & Company management system. It provides both educational examples of OOP and a full-featured web app using those principles.

---

## 📁 Project Breakdown

### 1. OOP Concepts Practice

**Practice folders include simple examples to learn OOP topics:**

* **Inheritance** → `employee.js`, `student.js`
* **Polymorphism** → `Polymorphism/script.js`
* **Abstraction** → `Abstraction/script.js`

Each file shows small demo classes for animals, shapes, students, etc., showcasing:

* Class-based inheritance
* Method overriding
* Abstract-like behavior using base/derived classes

### 2. CrewCore Dashboard - Full Project

A modern portal that manages **Employee** and **Company** records.

#### ✨ Key Features:

* Glassmorphism-styled dark UI with sidebar
* Add/Edit/Delete employees and companies
* Company-wise filtering
* Modular form-based design
* LocalStorage-based data persistence
